# Kaggle

Code from previous Kaggle Contests.
The code is somewhat being consolidated because I worked on a different system at the time. Also the trainiing data is typically removed from these folders, as they tend to be much larger in size than can be uploaded. Previously, I had unzipped many of the datasets, but more recently, I am leaving them as gzip files as pandas can read from these directy and can save a significant amount of space.
